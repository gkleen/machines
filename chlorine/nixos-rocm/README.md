# Radeon Open Compute (2.0.0) packages for NixOS

## Installation

This overlay should work with the latest nixos-unstable channel. To use these
packages, clone this repo somewhere and then add `(import /path/to/this/repo)`
to `nixpkgs.overlays` in `configuration.nix`.

As of ROCm 1.9.0, mainline kernels newer than 4.17 may be used with the ROCm stack.

Add these lines to configuration.nix to enable the ROCm stack:
```
  boot.kernelPackages = pkgs.linuxPackages_4_19;
  hardware.opengl.enable = true;
  hardware.opengl.extraPackages = [ pkgs.rocm-opencl-icd ]
```

After a `nixos-rebuild` and a reboot, both of these should work:
```
  nix-shell -p rocminfo --run rocminfo
  nix-shell -p opencl-info --run opencl-info
```

(for the former, it may be necessary to link the rocm overlay into
~/.config/nixpkgs/overlays/ so that the rocminfo package is available.)

OpenCL applications should work, and `glxinfo` should report that the Mesa
stack is running hardware-accelerated on an AMD gpu.

### NixOS 17.09/older unstable

If you are using a recent version of nixpkgs that does not contain commit
f620b1b (such as the nixos-17.09 channel), this overlay is likely to work if
commit 5750406 is reverted.  However, this configuration is not frequently
tested, and is not guaranteed to work.

## Hardware support

So far, this has only been tested with a Radeon Vega Frontier Edition and an RX 580.  Other cards supported by the upstream ROCm should also work, but have not been tested. Please let us know if we can expand the list of expected-to-work hardware!

## Highlights of Included Software

Libraries and compilers for: [OpenCL](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm-OpenCL-Runtime), [HCC](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/hcc), [HIP](https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP), and [TensorFlow](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/tensorflow-upstream).
