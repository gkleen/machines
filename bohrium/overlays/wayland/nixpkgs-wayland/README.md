## Overview

Automated, pre-built packages for Wayland (sway/wlroots) tools for NixOS.

(related: [nixpkgs-chromium](https://github.com/colemickens/nixpkgs-chromium) - Chromium with native Wayland support)

## Usage

The [NixOS Wiki page on Overlays](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Overlays)
shows how to activate the overlay.

The [Cachix landing page for `nixpkgs-wayland`](https://nixpkgs-wayland.cachix.org) shows how to utilize the binary cache. Packages from this overlay are regularly built against `nixos-unstable` and pushed to this cache.

#### Example Usage

```nix
{ config, lib, pkgs, ... }:
let
  rev = "master"; # could be a git rev, to pin the overlay (not usually recommended)
  url = "https://github.com/colemickens/nixpkgs-wayland/archive/${rev}.tar.gz";
  waylandOverlay = (import (builtins.fetchTarball url));
in
  {
    nixpkgs.overlays = [ waylandOverlay ];
    environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ wayvnc ];
    # ...
  }
```

## Tips

#### `sway`

* You will likely want a default config file to place at `$HOME/.config/sway/config`. You can use the upstream default as a starting point: https://github.com/swaywm/sway/blob/master/config.in
* I recommend using [`home-manager`](https://github.com/rycee/home-manager/). It has options for enabling and
  configuring Sway.
* I've recently learned that simply running `sway` at a TTY can be considered insecure. If Sway crashes, the TTY
  is left in an unlocked state. Running Sway with a DM or as `exec sway` can help mitigate this concern.

#### `obs-studio` + `wlrobs`

* I recommend using [`home-manager`](https://github.com/rycee/home-manager/). It has options for enabling and
  configuring OBS and `obs-wlrobs`. Enabling this overlay and those options is sufficient.

## Development Guide

* Use `nix-shell`.
* `./nixbuild.sh` is a wrapper I use to make sure my binary cache(s) are used,
  even if this repo is cloned on a random builder VM/machine/etc.
* `./update.sh`:
  * updates `pkgs/<pkg>/metadata.nix` with the latest commit+hash for each package
  * updates `nixpkgs/<channel>/metadata.nix` per the upstream channel
  * calls `nix-build build.nix` to build all packages against both channels
  * pushes to ["nixpkgs-wayland" on cachix](https://nixpkgs-wayland.cachix.org)

Note: in some cases, you may need to manually update `cargoSha256` or `vendorSha256` in `pkgs/<pkg>/metadata.nix` as well.
