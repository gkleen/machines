#+TITLE: README

This is my way of using [[https://nixos.org/][NixOS]] to configure some of my machines. The subdirectory
=embedded/= additionally contains some experiments using [[https://nixos.org/nix][Nix]]; perhaps most
interestingly I have expressions for building a [[https://coreboot.org/][coreboot]] ROM. Caveat emptor!
These images are not tested in any way as of now.
